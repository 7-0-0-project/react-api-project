## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, Fitness app is for people starting a fitness journey wanting to organize their workouts. It allows users to see what type of workouts they can do within each body part.


## API

This application will use the excercisedb API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use.

- Link to API documentation: https://v2.exercisedb.io/docs/static/index.html
- [API endpoint #1] : 'https://exercisedb.p.rapidapi.com/exercises/bodyPart/back'
  - endpoint: /exercises/bodyPart/{bodyPart}
- 'https://exercisedb.p.rapidapi.com/exercises/equipment/assisted'
  - endpint: /exercises/equipment/{type}
- 'https://exercisedb.p.rapidapi.com/exercises/name/%7Bname%7D'
  - endpoint: /exercises/name/{name}

API does require an API key.
